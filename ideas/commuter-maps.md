# Summary
TLDR; a stress-free maps app with no ETAs.

Maps app optimized for UX on a daily commute where the user already knows how to get 
to the destination and uses a maps app to determine the best time to leave, or how 
to avoid traffic on the current route.

# Goal 
Provide a good maps experience for car commuters.

## Core
### Toggle live ETA; no need to watch the clock tick
A lot of commutes are fixed-demand; I'll leave work regardless of the traffic, 
unless the traffic is really bad. And if I have a long commute in general, I 
know how long it takes, I don't want to be reminded of it each time I look at
maps. 

### Blurred ETAs; you don't notice an extra minute unless you read it
Don't cause undue stress for the user by telling them a very precise ETA. 
I've found that even if it's only a minute longer than usual, I feel a little
more stressed, despite that I likely wouldn't have noticed if the app didn't tell me.

Instead of telling the user '35m', tell them it'll be the normal duration. Inform
them about significant changes from the normal, but don't tell them about minor 
increases or decreases. 

### Easily check ETA; the user can quickly check the ETA for their route
See blurred ETA easily, so the user can determine whether its a good time to
leave or not.
